### Introduction

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a free and open-source framework designed to quickly build and share data web applications. What is a web application, you might ask? From [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Web-application-Web-app), a web application is an interactive program stored on a remote server that is delivered over the internet through a browser interface.

The best thing about Streamlit is that it requires less code than other web app tools. In fact, it is such little code that you can have your app up and running within minutes! After reading this blog post, you can have a working web app to display whatever kind of information you want.


### Documentation

The thing that will be of most help in building your own web app is the [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) that Streamlit already provides. While I will be going into some specific options that I used while creating my own Streamlit App, the Documentation supplies everything else you may desire. Let's go through one example now.
