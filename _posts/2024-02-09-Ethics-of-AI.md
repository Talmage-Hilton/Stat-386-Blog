<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will dive into the ethics of using AI in data science. We will look at a brief history of AI, how it is developed, and potential issues in its deployment.</p>


### A History of AI

AI was birthed in 1950, when British mathematician, Alan Turing, created a test of machine intelligence. If you've seen the film "The Imitation Game" then you are familiar with this story. Turing, however, was greatly weighed down by the technology of his time. Computers needed to greatly develop before there could be any hope of true artifical intelligence.

The following two decades would see a huge level of advancement in artifical intelligence. Programming languages, speeches, robots, and even vehicles were all invented in the name of AI. Though rudimentary compared to today's machines, the public learned from these creations what the future could look like.

After a huge boom in the 1980s, the public was gradually given more and more access to AI machines. Windows released a speech recognition software in the early 2000s, the first Roomba (an autonomous vacuum) was unveiled, social media companies began using AI as part of their algorithms, and companies like Apple and Google rolled out their virtual assistants. Most recently, of course, has been the invention of ChatGPT and Dall-E. For a more complete explanation of AI's past, read the following [history from Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/history#:~:text=Birth%20of%20AI%3A%201950%2D1956&text=into%20popular%20use.-,Dates%20of%20note%3A,ever%20learn%20the%20game%20independently.).

While these inventions undoutedbly contributed to making life easier in many ways, there are things we need to be very careful about with AI.
